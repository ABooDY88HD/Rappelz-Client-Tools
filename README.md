Uploading all of the scripts and programs I used with Rappelz without modifications, so please don't midn the horrible coding style as well as fixed paths and such.  
  
**Rappelz Client Tools**  
I used these programs to modify the client used on DarknessFight.  
- Rappelz Data Repacker: Dont mind it, mostly used for some testing.  
- XCleaner: Cleans the client, removes duplicates and removes unused indexes.
- XResource: looks like I just used it to encode/decode the files for the Resource folder
- XResourceManager: Patches the Resource folder into the client.
